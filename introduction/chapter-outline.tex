\section{Chapter Outline}
This thesis are organized into three parts. In the first part, chapter 2, some fundamental concepts in FDTD are
reviewed. As discussed above, in this chapter Maxwell's equations are tried to be reorganized into scraps excluding
different concepts. Overlaping functionalities between Freespace, Perfectly Matched Layer, and Dispersive Material are
taken apart for reusing. A recent research to improve processing of Dispersive Material is also shown. Collaboration
between Periodic Boundary Conditions and Total Field / Scatter Field is discussed. All formulas are derived for three
dimensions case and specialized for two dimensions and one dimension cases.

In chapter 3, 

In the final part, chapter 4, we would show you some applications to surface plasmonic structure.
