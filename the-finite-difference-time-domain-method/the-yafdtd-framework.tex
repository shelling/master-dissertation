\section{The yaFDTD Framework}

In prior sections, all common components of FDTD were depicted. All the formula has been implemented in the Python programming
language to be a software framework named yet another Finite-Difference Time-Domain framework, The repository of this
framework is at \tt http://github.com/shelling/yafdtd \rm. A well-designed framework can reduce the time to developing and
modeling a new simulation in the future so that it's worthy to spend one section introducing the usages of the
framework.
