\section{Modeling of Objects}
\label{sec:modeling}

\subsection{center shift}
In previous section, Eq.\ref{eq:dispersive} has provide clear view for modeling of objects: by marking $\epsilon_r$ and
$a, b, c,d$ coefficients of $J_p$ for each point of computation domain, it does. However, in consequence of coordinate
transformation done with Eq.\ref{eq:coordinate_transform}, the center should be shifted for different component of
fields.

For example, there is a dielectric sphere with center $(i_0,j_0,k_0)$ and radius $r_0$. Due to the convenience, the
$E_x|_{i+\frac{1}{2},j,k}$ field was saved as $E_x[i,j,k]$ in computer memory. Corresponding $\epsilon_{rx}[i,j,k]$ have
to be marked with the sphere with center $(i_0-1/2, j_0, k_0)$ and radius $r_0$ in the coordinate in computer memory.

The rest five components of fields should also be shifted as following
\begin{displaymath}
  E_y \rightarrow (0,-1/2,0)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  E_z \rightarrow (0,0,-1/2)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  H_x \rightarrow (0,-1/2,-1/2)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  H_y \rightarrow (-1/2,0,-1/2)
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  H_z \rightarrow (-1/2,-1/2,0)
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{modeling scheme}
Another issue of modeling is about curved surface. Finite-Difference strategy makes surface to be shape of sawteeth in
original Stair-Case scheme: it's a flip-flop view on dispersive coefficents. The high reflection and non-linear effect
on the surface increase error in Stair-Case. Index-Average scheme is a common impovement to Stair-Case by assigning
average coefficents to points at the edge through the proportion. The Conformal scheme is another solution proposed by
\textit{Mohzmmadi et al}. By importing a fourth order time-stepping scheme, it performs better that Index-Average.
