\section{Boundary Conditions}
\label{sec:bcs}
There kinds of Boundary Conditions are applied in this research: Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions, Perfectly
Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions and Periodic Boundary Conditions.
\subsection{Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions}

The Absorbing Boundary Conditions were proposed

\subsection{Perfectly Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions}
\label{subsec:pml}
For 2-D and 3-D simulation, the ABC discussed above is no longer useful due to the reason the ABC can only absorb
normally incident wave. Berenger's PML, aka Split-Field PML, was firstly proposed. UPML and CPML...

By inserting coefficients of UPML into Eq.\ref{eq:up_d} and Eq.\ref{eq:up_b}.
\begin{gather}
  j\omega\bar{\bar{s}}\ \widetilde{D}(\omega) = c_0\curlH(\omega)\\
  j\omega\bar{\bar{s}}\ \widetilde{B}(\omega) = -c_0\curlE(\omega)
\end{gather}
where $\bar{\bar{s}}$ should satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\bar{s}} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \displaystyle\frac{s_ys_z}{s_x}& 0& 0\\
    0& \displaystyle\frac{s_xs_z}{s_y}& 0\\
    0& 0& \displaystyle\frac{s_xs_y}{s_z}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
expand to three dimension
\begin{gather}
  j\omega s_y s_z \widetilde{D}_x = c_0 s_x \curlHxThree\\
  j\omega s_x s_z \widetilde{D}_y = c_0 s_y \curlHyThree\\
  j\omega s_x s_y \widetilde{D}_z = c_0 s_z \curlHzThree\\
  j\omega s_y s_z \widetilde{B}_x =-c_0 s_x \curlExThree\\
  j\omega s_x s_z \widetilde{B}_y =-c_0 s_y \curlEyThree\\
  j\omega s_x s_y \widetilde{B}_z =-c_0 s_z \curlEzThree
\end{gather}
reduce to two dimension




\subsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions}

For simulating Bloch periodic structure such as Photonic Crystals, the periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were useful
to reduce the simulation region
