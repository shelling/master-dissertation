\section{Boundary Conditions}
\label{sec:bcs}
There kinds of Boundary Conditions are applied in this research: Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions, Perfectly
Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions and Periodic Boundary Conditions.
\subsection{Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions}

The Absorbing Boundary Conditions were proposed

\subsection{Perfectly Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions}
\label{subsec:pml}

For 2-D and 3-D simulation, the ABC discussed above is no longer useful due to the reason the ABC can only absorb
normally incident wave.

the implementation of Berenger's PML

aka Split-Field PML
\subsubsection{Unaxial PML}
the implementations of Unaxial PML

\begin{equation}
  \bar{\bar{s}} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \displaystyle\frac{s_ys_z}{s_x}& 0& 0\\
    0& \displaystyle\frac{s_xs_z}{s_y}& 0\\
    0& 0& \displaystyle\frac{s_xs_y}{s_z}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Convolution PML}
the implementations of Convolution PML

\subsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions}

For simulating Bloch periodic structure such as Photonic Crystals, the periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were useful
to reduce the simulation region
