\section{Boundary Conditions}
There kinds of Boundary Conditions are applied in this research: Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions, Perfectly
Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions and Periodic Boundary Conditions.
\subsection{Analytic Absorbing Boundary Conditions}

The Absorbing Boundary Conditions were proposed

\subsection{Perfectly Matched Layer Absorbing Boundary Conditions}

For 2-D and 3-D simulation, the ABC discussed above is no longer useful due to the reason the ABC can only absorb
normally incident wave.

aka Split-Field PML
\subsubsection{Unaxial PML}
the implementations of Unaxial PML
\subsubsection{Convolution PML}
the implementations of Convolution PML

\subsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions}

For simulating Bloch periodic structure such as Photonic Crystals, the periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were useful
to reduce the simulation region
