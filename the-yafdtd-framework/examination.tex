\section{examination}
Phasor distribution of single silver rod is easy to obtain via frequency domain method. By performing Fourier transform
on timeline of FDTD result reaching steady state, a good approximation is expected. To ensure the yaFDTD framework to
carry out a credible result, comparison result between exact solution and FDTD is a good index.

The example here is a nano cylinder with radius 25 nm,
